This repository contains an updated haMSM (history augmented Markov state model) pipeline to analyze nonequilibrium steady state WE (weighted ensemble) simulations. 

- `haMSM_functions.py` contains functions necessary to run the haMSM analysis. 
- `haMSM_script.py` contains an example pipeline of analyzing the WE simulation data of NTL9 protein folding. 
- `reference.pdb` contains a reference (folded) structure of the NTL9 protein.
